## Commands
### Note
    1. Our terminal starts with something like "user@hostname$" or "user@hostname#"
    2. If the last symbol is "$" means you are logged in as a user
    3. If the last symbol is "#" means you are logged in as root

### Basic commands
```bash
id   # tells about you(user)

hostname    # tells the hostname

uname    # username(Linux)

ifconfig    # networking stuffs

ip    # more networking stuffs

netstat    # status of your network
